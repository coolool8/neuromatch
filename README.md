A set of completed tutorials on the basics of computational neuroscience - from neuromatch 2021


Some of these are saved in the google colab format because I had issues with my anaconda distribution while running through the tutorials. They are also a bit unorganized,
so I'm mostly putting them up as a way of putting a bow on the whole course.
